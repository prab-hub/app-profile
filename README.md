# app-profile

In this project, I analyzed the android & apple play store apps to find a profitable category to build new app.

- Read data from both play stores
- Data Exploration
- Data Cleaning
- Identifying free apps (as my focus is free apps)
- Grouping apps based on category/genre
- Finding popular category for both play stores

Please note than this project was carried out with basic Python skills. It could be optimized using Pandas.
